### Importance of Identifying Design Properties
Understanding design properties such as colors, typography, and layout choices ensures consistency across the entire application. By clearly defining these elements from the start, the development team can maintain a unified look and feel. It also reduces ambiguity, speeds up collaboration between designers and developers, and helps create a professional, user-friendly product that aligns with user expectations.
