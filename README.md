# AirBnB Clone Project

This is a full-stack clone of the AirBnB platform. The goal is to build a functional web application where users can browse property listings, view details, and complete bookings.

## Project Goals
- Learn to implement responsive UI/UX designs
- Understand how to structure a complex web application
- Gain experience in team collaboration and defined roles
- Practice component-based frontend architecture
- Apply best practices in web application development

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express or Django REST Framework
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub
- **Design:** Figma for UI/UX
- **Deployment:** Docker, CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals
- Create an intuitive booking flow that minimizes steps for the user.  
- Maintain visual consistency across all pages.  
- Ensure fast loading times and optimized performance.  
- Prioritize mobile-first responsiveness.  

### Key Features
- Property search with filtering and sorting options.  
- Detailed property view with images, amenities, and booking options.  
- Secure and simple checkout process.  
- User authentication for bookings and favorites.  

### Primary Pages

| Page                   | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Property Listing View** | Grid display of available properties with search, filters, and sorting options. |
| **Listing Detailed View** | Full property details including photos, amenities, reviews, and booking form.   |
| **Simple Checkout View**  | Streamlined checkout page with price summary, payment form, and confirmation.  |

### Color Styles (from Figma)
- **Primary:** `#FF5A5F`  
- **Secondary:** `#008489`  
- **Background:** `#FFFFFF`  
- **Text:** `#222222`  
- **Secondary Text:** `#717171`  

### Typography (from Figma)
- **Primary Font:** Circular  
- **Headings:** Bold (700), 24pxâ€“32px  
- **Body Text:** Medium (500), 16px  
- **Secondary Text:** Book (400), 14px  

### Importance of Identifying Design Properties
Understanding design properties such as colors, typography, and layout choices ensures consistency across the entire application. By clearly defining these elements from the start, the development team can maintain a unified look and feel. It also reduces ambiguity, speeds up collaboration between designers and developers, and helps create a professional, user-friendly product that aligns with user expectations.

## UI Component Patterns

To maintain a consistent and reusable interface, the project will define common UI components. These will be built as modular pieces so they can be reused across multiple pages.

### Planned Components

**Navbar**
- Displays the site logo.  
- Includes a search bar for quick property lookups.  
- Provides navigation links (Home, Trips, Favorites, Profile).  
- Features a responsive mobile menu.  

**Property Card**
- Displays a property image.  
- Shows key details: price per night, location, rating.  
- Includes a "favorite" button for saving properties.  
- Designed to adapt to grid layouts on desktop and mobile.  

**Footer**
- Displays links to site pages and policies.
